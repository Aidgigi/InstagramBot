# InstaRedditBot
A new Reddit bot that serves to make the gap between Reddit and Instagram smaller. Link an Instagram account to your subreddit, wait for the account to post, and voila, the bot posts on your subreddit. With 4 modes, and 4 submodes, how to bot posts is up to you. New features will be added often, so don't be afraid to request one now!

## Adding the Bot
Follow the steps in order to add the bot to your subreddit!

### Modes
The bot's regular and submodes
#### Regular Modes
These are the various modes you can use when registering with the bot.
* `Mode 1` Regular posting
* `Mode 2` The bot's posts will be stickied, and will remain until manually removed.
* `Mode 3` The bot's posts will be locked.
* `Mode 4` The bot's posts will be stickied and locked.
* **Note!** For modes 2, 3, and 4, you will need to add the bot as a moderator with "Post" privileges.

#### Submodes
These submodes will define how the bot comments on its posts.
* `Mode 1` The bot will leave no comment on its post.
* `Mode 2` The bot will comment the caption of the original Instagram post.
* `Mode 3` The bot will comment a link to the original Instagram account.
* `Mode 4` The bot will comment both the original caption, and a link to the Instagram account.
* **Note!** If the regular mode is set to 2, 3, or 4, the comment the bot leaves will follow the same sticky/lock rules.

### Steps
#### Step 1
1. Determine which modes you would like the bot to be registered with.
2. If the bot needs moderator privileges, as in the case of modes 2, 3, or 4, add the bot as a mod **before** submitting a request.
3. Make sure you moderate the subreddit you wish to add the bot to, you will need full permissions in order to add it.

#### Step 2
1. Begin a message to u/InstaRedditBot bot [here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=InstaRedditBot)
2. In the subject field, add the word "register"
3. In the body, write the subreddit you wish to add the bot to, **without** the "r/".
4. After that, add a semicolon (;). **do not** add a space after the semicolon.
5. After the semicolon, write the Instagram account you wish to add **(no @)**.
6. Repeat step 4.
7. Add your desired mode, then add a semicolon, and your desired submode, finished with another semicolon.
* An example request would look like: `dankmemes;salad.snake;1;4;`

* Each subreddit can only have one Instagram account linked to it for free. If you wish to add multiple—or even unlimited—accounts to your subreddit, please contact
